As creators and contributors to this project, we aim to build a harmonious, friendly, open, and supportive community. We fully respect everyone who contributes to the community, including reporting issues, updating documentation, and other beneficial contributions. We welcome people from diverse backgrounds to join us.

We will ensure that all participants can engage in this project in a respectful and friendly environment, regardless of their skin color, appearance, gender, nationality, sexual orientation, education level, or relevant experience.

The following are some unacceptable behaviors:

Personal attacks

Maliciously posting insulting or offensive remarks

Harassment (public or private)

Making sexualized innuendos in any way

Disclosing others' personal information, such as addresses or phone numbers, without explicit permission

Other unethical behaviors

For members who violate the above rules, the project maintainers have the right to delete any statements, requests, code, etc., that do not conform to the code of conduct. Furthermore, for members who violate this community code of conduct, the project and community maintainers will ban them from participating in community activities or contributing, and may temporarily or permanently remove them from the community. We will provide assistance to members who have been harmed.

This Code of Conduct applies to all members of the community and all their statements (whether within the project or on public community platforms).

The community has a working group composed of community members to handle all reports of violations of the Code of Conduct. This working group consists of community maintainers, contributors, and ordinary user volunteers. For any of the aforementioned misconduct, such as harassment, please contact the working group via email (lshuhang@student.ubc.ca) to report it. All reports will not be publicly displayed; they will only be visible to working group members. The working group is obligated to protect the information security of those who report violations. Working group members include:

All complaints will be reviewed by the working group, and appropriate responses and actions will be taken based on the specific circumstances.
